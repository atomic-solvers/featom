!> @brief Double precision LAPACK subroutines
!> @details This is the precision that LAPACK "d" routines were compiled with (typically
!> double precision, unless a special compiler option was used while compiling
!> LAPACK). This "dp" is only used in lapack.f90
!> The "d" routines data type is defined as "double precision", so
!> we make "dp" the same kind as 0.d0 ("double precision"), so
!> as long as LAPACK and this file were compiled with the same compiler options,
!> it will be consistent. (If for example all double precision is promoted to
!> quadruple precision, it will be promoted both in LAPACK and here.)
!>
!> The remaining documentation is taken from [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/index.html) and can be augmented by the [quick reference guide](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~domijank/lapack.pdf)
