# featom: Finite Element Solvers for Atomic Structure Calculations

This library implements accurate and efficient radial Schrödinger and Dirac
finite element solvers. The formulation admits general potentials and meshes:
uniform, exponential, or other. Additionally, a squared Hamiltonian approach has
been used for the Dirac equation, which eliminates spurious states.

## Article

Detailed description of methods, convergence studies and implementation details
may be found in the following article:

> Čertík, Ondřej, et al. High-Order Finite Element Method for Atomic Structure Calculations. arXiv, 11 July 2023. arXiv.org, http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05856.

## Accuracy

With the provided meshes, the solvers (both Schrödinger and Dirac) can converge
to at least 1e-8 Ha accuracy (with double precision of approximately 16
significant digits) for all eigenvalues and total DFT energies for all atoms up
to uranium (Z=92).

The converged nonrelativistic and relativistic results agree with
[dftatom](https://github.com/certik/dftatom) to
1e-8 Ha accuracy, and with the NIST benchmarks to the stated accuracy of those
benchmarks (2e-6 Ha in eigenvalues and 1e-6 Ha in total energies).

The accuracy is on par with [dftatom](https://github.com/certik/dftatom/) and
uses significantly less computationally expensive routines.

## Compilation
<!-- TODO: Make bindings and document with Sphinx -->
This program is packaged with `fpm`, the [Fortran package manager](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/).

``` bash
# All of these can be passed the --profile=release flag
fpm build
fpm test
fpm run --profile=release conv -- 0 0 5
```

Where the parameters to `conv` are:

> ! <study_type> can be,
> !       0: error as p is varied
> !       1: error as rmax is varied
> !       2: error as Ne is varied
> !
> ! <equation> can be,
> !       0: Schroedinger
> !       1: Dirac
> !
> ! For <study_type>
> !       0, 1: 3rd parameter = Ne (Number of elements)
> !       2   : 3rd parameter = p  (Polynomial order)
>

### Setting up

We can use an `anaconda` helper like `micromamba` (installation instructions [are here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

We can now set up the tools needed.

``` bash
# Global
micromamba install fpm  -c conda-forge
# Project Local
micromamba create -p ./tmp fpm -c conda-forge
micromamba activate ./tmp
# Optionally: blas lapack openmp gfortran
# Best obtained with a package manager
# Alternative
micromamba create -f environment.yml # creates fe
micromamba activate fe
```

## Testing

Tests can be run by:
```
fpm test
```

## Linting

A `pre-commit` job has been setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is
best to set it up locally as well (using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
for isolation):

```sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
```

## Documentation

The API documentation is generated by [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) with the [doxyYoda](https://github.com/HaoZeke/doxyYoda) theme.
